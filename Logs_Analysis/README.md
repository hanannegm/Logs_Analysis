# Log Analysis Project

## Description
A reporting tool that prints out reports (in plain text) based on the data in a newspaper log database. This reporting tool is a Python program using the psycopg2 module to connect to the database.

### How to Run the Program

#### Requirements
  * [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
  * [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
  * [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

#### Setup Project:
  1. Install Vagrant and VirtualBox, Please check [instructions to install the virtual machine](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud197/lessons/3423258756/concepts/14c72fe3-e3fe-4959-9c4b-467cf5b7c3a0)
  2. Download or Clone this repository in the /vagrant directory **You must finish step 1 first**.
  #### Prepare the Software and Data
 1. The virtual machine from step 1
 
       If you need to bring the virtual machine back online with `$ vagrant up`. Then log into it with `$ vagrant ssh`
 2. Download the data from [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/August/57b5f748_newsdata/newsdata.zip)
    1. Unzip this file after downloading it. The file inside is called newsdata.sql.
    2. To run the reporting tool, you'll need to load the site's data into your local database. To load the data, use the command 
        ```
        psql -d news -f newsdata.sql
        ```
    3. The database includes three tables:
        - The `authors` table includes information about the authors of articles.
        - The `articles` table includes the articles themselves.
        - The `log` table includes one entry for each time a user has accessed the site.
 3. Creating Views:
    1. Use `psql -d news` to connect to database.
    2. create view `collect` using:
        ```sql
        CREATE VIEW collect AS
          SELECT articles.title AS article_title,
                 articles.author AS author_id,
                 authors.name AS author_name,
                 count(log.path) AS views
          FROM  log, articles, authors
          WHERE log.path LIKE ('%' || articles.slug)
                AND authors.id = articles.author
          GROUP BY article_title, author_id, author_name
          ORDER BY views DESC;
#### Run the Tool :boom:
1. From the vagrant directory inside the virtual machine, run `logs_analysis.py` using: 
    ```
    $ python3 logs_analysis.py
    ```
2. Check the output file for the results `output.txt`
